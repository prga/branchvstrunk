## Repository Structure

All materials related to our study, including interview scripts, survey questionnaires, and analysis scripts, are available in this replication package. The repository is structured as follows:

-   **/survey_package/:** Contains all artifacts related to the survey.
    -   **/code/:** Python scripts used to generate the graphs from the survey data.
    -   **/graphs/:** Graphs generated by the analysis scripts, available in PDF format.
    -   **anonymized_survey_answers.xlsx:** The anonymized **raw data** collected through the survey. The first row of each column corresponds to the survey question, and the following rows contain each respective answer.
-   **/interviews_package/:** Contains transcripts of the 22 interviews conducted in the study. Each interview has its own folder, which includes a file with the transcription in Portuguese.
-   **final_card_sorting.png:** Output of the card sorting activity used to consolidate the factors.

## How to Reproduce the Graphs

To reproduce the graphs from the survey data, please follow the steps below.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* The required Python libraries are listed in `survey_package/code/requirements.txt`.

> **⚠️ Note for Windows Users**
>
> Some of the Python libraries in this project (like `Numpy` and `Wordcloud`) require a C++ compiler to be installed on your system.
>
> If the `pip install` command fails with an error about missing compilers, you need to install the **Microsoft C++ Build Tools**. You can download them from the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-tools/build-tools/). During the installation, make sure to select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the necessary libraries by navigating to the root directory and running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r survey_package/code/requirements.txt
    ```

### Data Preprocessing

The Python scripts do not use the raw data directly. The `anonymized_survey_answers.xlsx` file contains the raw survey data and must be preprocessed before executing the scripts. The graph generation scripts were developed to use a processed version of the data, which should be saved as `survey.csv`.

Data processing included tasks such as:

* **Column Renaming:** To facilitate data access via code, columns with long names were renamed. For example, the column `"How many years of programming experience do you have?"` was renamed to `YearsProgramming`.
* **Data Categorization:** Qualitative responses were analyzed and categorized. For instance, data from the column `"Regarding the project you are currently working on..., describe the step-by-step process of a code change..."` were pair-analyzed and classified as `branch-based` or `trunk-based` in the `branchORtrunk` column.

### Execution

1.  To generate the graphs, first convert and process the `anonymized_survey_answers.xlsx` file as described in the Data Preprocessing section and save the result as `survey.csv`.
2.  Place the generated `survey.csv` file inside the `survey_package/code/` directory.
3.  Navigate to the code directory:
   
    ```bash
    cd survey_package/code/
    ```
    
5.  Run any of the Python scripts to generate the corresponding graph. For example:
   
    ```bash
    python boxplot_experience.py
    ```

The output graph (e.g., `boxplot_experience.png`) will be saved in the same directory. All other analyses were conducted manually and are described in Section 2 of the paper.
